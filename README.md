## write small test
- test should be small and test only one thing at a time
- helps pinpoint the problem

## write test that's easy to read
- test should be written in a way that is easy to understand both for yourself and for other developers who may need to work on the code in the future

## write tests that are independent
- tests should be repeatable so that they can be run multiple times without changing the results

## write tests that are comprehensive
- should cover all the test cases the code is expected to handle
